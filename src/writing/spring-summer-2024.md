I've had a pretty crazy 2024 so far â€” but to be honest I kinda say that all the time, maybe that's just my life? ðŸ˜…

Anyway, wanted to do a wee summary of what I've been up to, blog posts I've written and read, and media!

## Life

Work recently has been pretty busy. We've had a big new job come up that's a lot more technical and involved than most of our work, so that's taken a lot of attention. I've also been getting more into dev management â€” performance reviews, hiring practices, standards, etc.

I've also dedicated a lot of attention to selling My Top for Spotify, a project I built a few years ago. Check out my blog post "[Selling a small front-end web project â€” what I learned](/writing/selling-web-project/)" for more info on that. The short version is that it was exciting, new, and took a lot of my focus for about 6 weeks!

Personal life and hobbies have taken more of a backseat than I'd have liked.

- We've had friends come to stay a few times â€” I **love** hosting people;
- Saw [Night Flight](https://nightflightofficial.com) and [The Japanese House](https://thejapanesehouse.co.uk) â€” live
- Went to Edinburgh Pride;
- Did a few hillwalks â€” less than I'd like but it's tricky without a car;
- Sat on a mountain with some friends for hours watching the perseid meteor shower;
- Spent a few days visiting family in the Highlands;
- Had a good Edinburgh fringe with 5 shows, a couple great ones;
- Went to the south of France near Marseille for a week.

I launched my [ko-fi page selling stickers and my art prints](https://ko-fi.com/alistairshepherd). The stickers have done well but the art prints less so. I'm not surprised, I haven't really pushed those much so need to do more.

I'm also regularly attending the [Homebrew Website Club](https://events.indieweb.org) meetup in Edinburgh. It's a good small group and a great chance to casually chat and catch up about the web!

Last weekend I went to the State of the Browser conference down in London which is always fantastic. The talks were exceptional this year and I have great fun meeting up with and making new friends.

## Posts from others I've enjoyed

I recently got back into RSS and reading blogs! I had 2500+ unread articles in my feed reader so declared RSS bankruptcy back in July, but have been keeping up since. It's been great to be reading more and I feel more creative, inspired, and excited about the web thanks to it!

## Media

I felt like I hadn't [read|watched|listened|played] as much media as I would've normally, but actually listing them out is quite a few! It didn't feel like much though!

### Games

I also now track my games on Infinite Backlog if you're interested or on there! I also ranked every game I've ever played* and produced a top 100** which was good fun! Here's the recent ones:

- [Agatha Christie: Murder on the Orient Express](https://infinitebacklog.net/games/agatha-christie-murder-on-the-orient-express--1)
- [Pentiment](https://infinitebacklog.net/games/pentiment)

\* at least as far as I remember
\*\* not quite 100 but close enough!
