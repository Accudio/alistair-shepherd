Some answers to questions about my experience blogging here and in the past! Been seeing this elsewhere and found them great fun to read. I'm also writing this at a [Homebrew Website Club Writing Hour](https://events.indieweb.org/2025/03/homebrew-website-club-edinburgh-writing-hour-wdGHAkmO8qtA) in Edinburgh, which has been great fun!

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

Work mostly! In 2017 I dropped out of university and was attempting freelance web development as a career, trying to make something out of the hobby I had for a few years.

My first few clients came pretty easily through friends, former colleagues and neighbours but after a few months the leads started to dry up.

To try and get more work and get my name out there I wrote several blog posts targeted to small business owners. The goal was to convince them to upgrade/improve their website and introduce them to some of the concepts.

Here are some of those early blog titles:
- The Web in 2017 and what it means for your Website and Social Media!
- Introducing: Responsive and Mobile-Focused Web Design
- Introducing: Content Management Systems

And they worked! Friends, family, and clients shared them mostly on Facebook and got me a handful more projects, including the big break that really drove my early career.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?

Currently my website is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev), a wonderful static site generator based on node.js. Reasons why I chose it:
- It's really simple
- Generates static HTML — easy and cheap to host and secure
- I'm in full control over the page content
- Blog content can be in markdown — super portable

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

My very first post was written on WordPress but never published on it. I'm a bit too extra sometimes so found that too mainstream for me.

I briefly used [Subrion CMS](https://subrion.org) for my first few posts as I was trying that out for the rest of my site, but quickly realised it wasn't great for blogging.

I then used [PageKit CMS](https://github.com/pagekit/pagekit), a PHP+Vue-based CMS that hasn't been touched in about 9 years. No particular reason for this one in particular really, I just liked it and it was niche and a little weird.

From 2018 to 2020 I didn't have a blog, and then for a brief period I used [dev.to](https://dev.to/accudio) before switching to my current stack in 2021. My blog posts are still cross-posted over on dev.to, hello if you're reading there!

## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that's part of your blog?

Always local, the tool itself varies though. This post right now I'm writing in [AnyType](https://anytype.io) which I'm trying as a local note-taking tool, but I've also used [iA writer](https://ia.net/writer), word documents, or just writing markdown straight into my code editor.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

Currently Sunday mornings end up being my writing time. Sunday tends to be my chill day and my partner gets up a bit later so I do an hour or two of writing with a tea after breakfast.

Previously it has been Friday afternoons with my work 'Personal development time', but that's been taken up by other stuff more recently.

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

Generally immediately. My partner is a great proofreader and editor so for some posts I may ask him to proof and give me some feedback, in which case it simmers for a few days. If I'm not  getting it proofed though it goes live immediately.

## What are you generally interested in writing about?

Front-end web stuff mostly, but I've done and will do some non-web posts when something interests me enough.

## Who are you writing for?

Hmmm that's a tricky one!

I want to say it's all for myself and often it is, to put down my thoughts somewhere permanent so I can reference them later.

I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience with others — it may be helpful and I tend to assume what I know everyone else does so it helps me stay on top of that assumption.

There's definitely a little bit of attention seeking, wanting people to see and recognise me. Also in my work it just makes good sense for my career — many of the people I want to network with, work with and be employed by care about blog posts. It's a good selling point!

## What's your favourite blog post?

My all time favourite is probably [SVG generative mountain ridge dividers,](https://alistairshepherd.uk/writing/svg-generative-ridges/) as thanks to [Dave Letorey](https://letorey.co.uk) from [State of the Browser](https://stateofthebrowser.com) it opened up the world of Conference talks to me.

Other top contenders for various reasons:
- [Selling a small front-end web project — what I learned](https://alistairshepherd.uk/writing/selling-web-project/)
- [My response to UK CMA's potential remedies for mobile browser competition](https://alistairshepherd.uk/writing/cma-mobile-browsers-remedies/)
- [GrapheneOS as my daily-driver mobile OS](https://alistairshepherd.uk/writing/grapheneos/)

## Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?

I currently have a complete redesign and rebuild in very early design stages. It has been there for about 14 months so far though so slow progress!

I'm struggling a little with the design but once I have that nailed it'll be all new gimmicks, themes, and features!

Whether it's a new platform I'm not yet sure, I love 11ty and it's super simple but have been considering a CMS for easier writing and editing on the go. I'm not convinced if I'm willing to give up the portability of markdown for that, we'll see!

## Who's next?

I've seen loads of people doing this and honestly have no idea who has and hasn't. If you're reading this though and haven't written one then I tag you! I did it based on [Sophie Koonin](https://localghost.dev/blog/the-blog-questions-challenge/) saying the same thing at the end of hers.
