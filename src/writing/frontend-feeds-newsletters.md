The world of Web Development is exciting and moves fast - particularly front end development in the past few years.

Although all of this innovation is great, it can sometimes be pretty difficult to keep up with. One of the ways I keep on top of the latest changes, trends and new technologies is by following the blogs and newsletters of companies and developers leading the industry.

I'm always on the lookout for more blogs or newsletters! If you have any suggestions I should check out [get in touch](#contact)!

## Intro { #intro tabindex="-1" }

I thought I'd crack out a post I can point people to with a list of the feeds and newsletters I subscribe to, with a bit of hopefully useful info so you know if you want to subscribe yourself. Most of these are focused on:

- Front End Development
- Full-Stack development
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Accessibility
- Web Performance
- Browsers
- 11ty

I find it quite fun that the format for the majority of these feeds about modern web development is RSS, a technology that has existed since 1999! If you're looking for a feed reader I use Feedbin, which is a great cloud RSS and newsletter reader across multiple platforms. You can also find an [export of my RSS subscriptions](https://github.com/accudio/rss) on [my Github](https://github.com/accudio).

## Browser Vendors { #browsers tabindex="-1" }

Useful for keeping up with changes to the biggest browsers. Topics can be quite technical and writing not particularly approachable, but probably worth a look. I tend to scan the titles to decide if it's something that will likely affect me before reading.

- [Google Chrome blog](https://blog.google/products/chrome/) [[feed](https://blog.google/products/chrome/rss/)] — Fairly approachable summaries of changes, updates and new features coming to Google chrome and probably other chromium browsers;
- [Chromium Blog](https://blog.chromium.org) [[feed](http://blog.chromium.org/atom.xml)] — Similar to the Google Chrome blog but more technical, and posts summaries of every major version;
- [Mozilla Hacks](https://hacks.mozilla.org) [[feed](https://hacks.mozilla.org/feed/)] — Updates on Firefox and Gecko changes, mixture of technical level, summary of major updates;
- [Microsoft Edge Blog](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/) [[feed](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/feed
)] — MS' work on Blink and Chromium, will eventually come to all Chromium browsers so good to follow;
- [Planet Webkit](https://planet.webkit.org) [[feed](http://planet.webkit.org/atom.xml)] — Very technical updates to WebKit and Safari - useful however due to a lack of official Safari updates. Keep in mind WebKit changes can take months or even years to make their way to Safari;
- [Planet Igalia](https://planet.igalia.com/) [[feed](planet.igalia.com/rss20.xml)] — The Igalia team have contributed to all browsers, most recently :focus-visible in Safari. Some really deep-dives into very technical topics. Not for everyone.

## Company Blogs { #companies tabindex="-1" }

Any blogs by development agencies or dev-related products. A few of the agency blogs have some great tips, best practices and open-source tools. I tend to be a bit wary of product blogs as they're always trying to sell but there are some decent ones out there.

- [9Elements](https://9elements.com/blog/) [[feed](https://9elements.com/blog/rss/)] — Agency with some great front-end skills in their team. I particularly like Nils Binder's articles on layout like "[The Devil's Albatross](https://9elements.com/blog/the-devils-albatros-an-algorithmic-layout-technique/)";
- [Axess Lab](https://axesslab.com) [[feed](https://axesslab.com/feed/)] — Accessibility consultants, they have some great articles offering approachable summaries for accessibility topics including "[What is a screen reader?](https://axesslab.com/what-is-a-screen-reader/)";
- [Bejamas](https://bejamas.io/blog/) [[feed](https://bejamas.io/blog/rss.xml)] — An expert Jamstack agency, if you want more info on [Static Site Generators](https://bejamas.io/discovery/static-site-generators/) or [Headless CMS'](https://bejamas.io/discovery/headless-cms/) their articles are brilliant;
- [DebugBear](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/) [[feed](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/feed/rss)] — DebugBear sells web performance monitoring, I haven't used their product but they write some decent high-level articles about improving web performance.
- [Filament Group](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/) [[feed](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/atom.xml)] — If you've been on the web a while you've probably used a tool made by Filament Group! Authors of Respond.js, Picturefill, LoadCSS and [the most common async CSS pattern](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/load-css-simpler/) - they do great open-source work and really interesting articles about them.
- [Volument Minimalism](https://volument.com/blog/) [[feed](https://volument.com/rss.xml)] — Privacy-focused analytics, haven't used the product but their insight on analytics and modern development is interesting and straight to the point.

## Development Blogs { #dev-blogs tabindex="-1" }

Blogs generally aimed at sharing knowledge about web development. Separate from Developers and Magazines as they feel somewhere between the two.

- CSS { In Real Life } [[feed](https://css-irl.info/rss.xml)] — Generally short posts focused on CSS and layout. "[Detecting Hover-Capable Devices](https://css-irl.info/detecting-hover-capable-devices/)" is a great recent one to check out;

- [Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li) [[feed](https://piccalil.li/feed.xml)] — Piccalilli by Andy Bell has great tutorials and summaries on building modern front ends. Check out "[Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/)". The [Piccalilli community membership](https://piccalil.li/membership/) is also great if you're into that!
- [QuirksMode Blog](https://quirksmode.org/blog/) [[feed](https://quirksmode.org/blog/atom.xml)] — QuirksMode has been writing about the web since 2004, talking a lot about browsers and thinking about how the web as a whole should work. Great thinkpieces.
- [web.dev](https://web.dev/blog/) [[feed](https://web.dev/feed.xml)] — Posts mostly by Google Web Developers introducing and covering best practices and new features in the web. The [courses](https://web.dev/learn/) on the site are also well worth checking out;
- [Web Platform News](https://webplatform.news) [[feed](https://webplatform.news/feed.xml)] — Provides short updates on anything new in the web, including bugs and announcements you might not find elsewhere. Only available as a screenshot unless you pay $2/month on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/webplatformnews), worth considering though as I've found it very useful.
