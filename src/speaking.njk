      <h1>Speaking</h1>
      <p>One of the great things about the web and developing for it is how accessible it is. When I was learning I picked up so much from watching other developers speak about their work - and now I have more experience I love doing the same.</p>
      <p>I'm just getting started &mdash; which has been a bit tricky with <em>the global situation</em> &mdash; but am very keen to speak at meetups and conferences. I like speaking about Web Performance, CSS architecture, Images and Accessibility.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for someone to speak about any of those topics at your meetup or a conference please <a href="#contact">get in touch</a>!</p>
