        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I grew up in the Highlands of Scotland, and the wild mountains is always home for me. My programming and development skills are self-taught, and after a brief period studying Computatational Physics at the University of Dundee decided academia wasn't for me. I wanted to continue my hobby of building websites into a career, which is where I am today.</p>
        <p>When I'm not in front of my computer writing code, I love origami, video games, and listening to music Spotify categorises as "Indie Rock", "Indie Pop Rock", "Stomp and Holler" and "Hopebeat".</p>
        <p>Growing up in the Cairngorms and with Scottish Skiing on my doorstep I adore skiing, snowboarding, and mountains in general and you can often find me up a hill with either skis or walking boots on!</p>
